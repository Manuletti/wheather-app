challenge to create an app in 3 hours

Since I have some problems with creation of actual apps
i decided to build some apps from youtube tutorial but 
in limited time. 

Here is a Weather app from this tutorial:

I've watched it and now I am going to rebuid it by my memory
and using different weather api and so on.
